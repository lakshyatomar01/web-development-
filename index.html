        <h2>1. WHAT IS WEB DEVEPELEMENT </h2>
        <p>Web development, also known as website development, refers to the tasks associated with creating, building, and maintaining websites and web applications that run online on a browser. It may, however, also include web design, web programming, and database management.</p>
         <P>,,The basic tools involved in web development are programming languages called HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and JavaScript. There are, however, a number of other programs used to “manage” or facilitate the construction of sites that would otherwise have to be done “from scratch” by writing code. A number of content management systems (CMS) fall into this category, including WordPress, Joomla!, Drupal, TYPO3, and Adobe Experience Manager, among others.</P>

        <h2>2.TECHNOLOGY USED IN WEB DEVEPELEMENT</h2>
        <P>Web technologies refer to a set of tools, languages, and frameworks, like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, server-side scripting languages, and databases, that are used to develop websites and web applications. With evolving technology, to stay relevant in the industry, web developers need to be updated with the latest web technologies, including front-end development, back-end development, and full-stack development. Continuous learning and adaptability are key traits for any developer seeking success in the dynamic world of web development.</P>

        <h2>3. THE IMPOTANCE OF WEB TECHNOLOGY</h2>
        <P>Web technologies significantly impact not only the user experience but the website performance, as well. Using outdated or inefficient web technologies may result in slow website speed, poor user experience, and low search engine rankings. To build websites and web applications that meet modern standards, web developers must necessarily stay updated with the latest web technologies and web development tools.</P>

        <h2>4. HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE TO CODE A WEBSITE </h2>
        <p>it depends on the complexity of your website. For example, it will take a lot less time to launch a basic homepage with your business's address, contact information, and links to social media accounts than it will to build an online ordering portal that collects users' shipping information and processes payments.

            However, just because you save time in the beginning doesn't mean that more advanced features aren't worthwhile. It depends on your business. If you are only trying to get foot traffic to your store, then online ordering doesn't make sense.
            
            That said, you may miss out on customers that may not feel like driving to a physical location but would purchase through your website. If you don't have the bandwidth to ship items to your customers, then that's another good reason to pass on creating an ecommerce website</P>
